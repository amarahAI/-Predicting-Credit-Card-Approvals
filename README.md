# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals

Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money). In this project, I have built an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like real banks do.

• Credit card applications
• Inspecting the applications
• Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
• Handling the missing values
• Preprocessing the data
• Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
• Making predictions and evaluating performance
• Grid searching and making the model perform better
• Finding the best performing mode
